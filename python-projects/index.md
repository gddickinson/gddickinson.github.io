## FLIKA Plugins

FLIKA (Fluorescence Image Analysis) is an image processing program for biologists written in Python. I have developed several plugins extending its capabilities for advanced microscopy analysis.

### My FLIKA Plugins

#### [thunderSTORM](flika-plugins/thunderstorm.md)
Single Molecule Localization Microscopy analysis toolkit for super-resolution imaging.

#### [SPT Batch Analysis](flika-plugins/spt-batch.md)
Automated single particle tracking with multiple algorithms and batch processing.

#### [Cell Edge Movement](flika-plugins/cell-edge.md)
Quantitative analysis of cell membrane dynamics and edge movement.

#### [Mask Editor](flika-plugins/mask-editor.md)
Interactive ROI and mask editing with frame-by-frame control.
