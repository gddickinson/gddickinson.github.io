## Overview

Software development for 3D super-resolution and light-sheet microscopy data visualization and analysis of calcium imaging experiments, with focus on PIEZO1 mechanosensitive channel proteins.

---

## Research Focus

PIEZO1 channels are mechanically-activated ion channels that convert physical force into biological signals. This research investigates:

- PIEZO1 protein localization in cells
- Channel activity in response to mechanical stimuli
- Development of imaging tools for studying mechanotransduction
- Analysis workflows for super-resolution microscopy data

---

## Techniques

### Microscopy
- TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy
- 3D super-resolution imaging
- Light-sheet microscopy
- Live-cell calcium imaging

### Computational
- Custom Python analysis software
- Image processing pipelines
- Data visualization tools
- Automated batch analysis

---

## Tools Developed

### FLIKA Plugins
Development of custom plugins for fluorescence image analysis:
- SPT Batch Analysis for particle tracking
- thunderSTORM-FLIKA for super-resolution analysis
- Cell Edge Movement for membrane dynamics
