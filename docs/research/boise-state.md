## Project Overview

Development of a DNA-origami based digital storage platform for encoding, storing, and reading digital information using chemically synthesized DNA and super-resolution microscopy.

---

## Concept

DNA offers information density and stability advantages over traditional storage media:

- **Information density**: DNA can store data at densities far exceeding hard drives
- **Stability**: DNA remains stable for thousands of years under proper conditions
- **Energy efficiency**: No power required for storage
- **Quaternary code**: Uses A, G, C, T bases (4-state vs binary 2-state)

---

## Technical Approach

### DNA Origami Scaffold
- Used bacteriophage DNA as scaffold
- Programmed DNA to fold into "breadboard" structures
- Positioned staple strands at specific locations to encode information

### Data Encoding
- Digital information encoded into DNA sequences
- Staple strands positioned to represent binary data
- Error-correction algorithms implemented

### DNA-PAINT Readout
- Super-resolution microscopy technique
- Optically read encoded information at nanoscale resolution
- Achieved successful data recovery from DNA

---

## Key Achievement

Successfully encoded and optically read the message: "Data is in our DNA!"

This demonstrated proof-of-concept for DNA-based information storage with optical readout.
