## Overview

Utilized super-resolution and TIRF fluorescence microscopy to study intercellular calcium signals and signaling proteins at the single-cell and single-molecule level in cultured neuroblastoma cells.

---

## Research Focus

Investigation of calcium puffs - localized Ca²⁺ signals mediated by inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). This work pioneered optical patch-clamp techniques to resolve individual IP3R channel openings during calcium puffs.

### Key Questions
- How do IP3R channels cluster and coordinate their activity?
- What determines recruitment of channels during calcium puffs?
- How are calcium puffs terminated?
- What is the probability of triggering puffs based on cluster size?

## Technical Innovation

### Optical Patch-Clamp
Ian Parker developed single-channel calcium imaging using TIRF microscopy to:
- Resolve openings of individual IP3R channels
- Measure channel gating kinetics during puffs
- Quantify numbers of functional channels in clusters
- Study coupled channel closings

This technique provided unprecedented resolution of calcium channel dynamics.

## Major Findings

### Channel Recruitment
- Puff triggering probability is linearly related to number of IP3Rs in a cluster
- Channels recruit additional channels through calcium-induced calcium release (CICR)
- Individual puffs show wide amplitude variability even at sites with similar cluster size

### Puff Termination
- Multiple channels tend to close in near-synchrony
- Termination cannot be explained solely by Ca²⁺-inhibition
- Coupled gating of adjacent IP3Rs likely contributes to robust termination

### IP3 Diffusion
- IP3 diffusion is hindered in cytoplasm
- Diffusion coefficient is 10-fold lower than in water
- Findings impact understanding of spatial calcium signaling

### Temperature Dependence
- IP3-mediated calcium signals show strong temperature dependence
- Both local (puffs) and global signals affected
- Important for physiological relevance of in vitro studies
