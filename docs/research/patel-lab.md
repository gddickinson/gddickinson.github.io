## Overview

Characterization of NAADP (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) receptors and their role in lysosomal calcium signaling.

### 2008-2010: Lysosomal Calcium in Aging
Investigated the role of lysosomal calcium signaling in aging and disease in cultured neurons. Focus on two-pore channels (TPC1 and TPC2) as NAADP-sensitive calcium release channels.

### 2002-2004: NAADP Receptor Characterization
Characterized calcium-channel proteins in sea urchin eggs, establishing sea urchin as a model system for NAADP receptor studies.

## Research Contributions

### Lysosomal Calcium Signaling
- Identified alterations in lysosomal calcium content in presenilin-null cells
- Demonstrated changes in two-pore channel (TPC) expression
- Showed effects of lysosomal proliferation on calcium homeostasis in neurons
- Established link between lysosomal dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease

### NAADP Receptor Properties
- Characterized deviant NAADP-mediated calcium signaling upon lysosome proliferation
- Demonstrated time-sensing properties of NAADP receptors
- Showed requirement of phospholipids for NAADP binding
- Developed methods for determining cellular NAADP levels
- Characterized multiple NAADP receptor conformations

## Key Findings

### TPC Channels as NAADP Receptors
Work contributed to establishing two-pore channels as functional NAADP receptors, though later research showed TPC channels and TRPML1 are functionally independent organellar ion channels.

### Lysosomal Dysfunction
Demonstrated that:
- Lysosomal proliferation affects calcium homeostasis
- Presenilin loss alters lysosomal calcium stores
- TPC expression is affected by presenilin knockout
- These findings have implications for neurodegenerative diseases
