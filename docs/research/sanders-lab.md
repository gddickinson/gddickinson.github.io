## PhD Thesis

**Title:** "Ligand-gated calcium mobilization in higher plants"

**Award:** BBSRC Studentship (1998: 98/A1/C/04587) - Endomembrane Calcium Channels in Higher Plants

## Research Overview

Identified and characterized NAADP-induced calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum in higher plants. This work represented the first demonstration of NAADP-mediated calcium signaling in plant cells.

---

## Key Findings

### NAADP in Plant Cells
- Demonstrated NAADP elicits calcium release from plant ER
- Showed NAADP operates through a mechanism distinct from IP3
- Established plants as a model for studying NAADP signaling
- Characterized pharmacology of plant NAADP receptors

### Novel Signaling Pathway
This discovery expanded understanding of calcium signaling beyond animal systems and suggested evolutionary conservation of NAADP signaling mechanisms.

---

## Significance

### Cross-Kingdom Conservation
The presence of NAADP-mediated calcium signaling in both plants and animals suggested:
- Ancient evolutionary origin of this signaling pathway
- Fundamental importance of NAADP in cellular calcium regulation
- Potential for plants as experimental models for calcium signaling research

### Plant Signaling
Contributed to understanding of how plants respond to environmental stimuli through calcium signaling cascades.

- Pharmacological manipulation

### Plant Cell Biology
- Cell culture and protoplast preparation
- Subcellular fractionation
