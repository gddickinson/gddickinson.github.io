# Creative Music Generator

A sophisticated algorithmic composition system that combines fractal patterns, musical genetics, and advanced form structures to create complex musical compositions.

## Overview

This project implements a creative music generation system that uses multiple algorithmic approaches to create musical compositions. It combines:

- Fractal-based melody generation
- Advanced musical form structures
- Genetic algorithms for musical development
- Sophisticated harmony generation
- Multiple texture types and voice leading
- Visualization tools for musical analysis

## Components

The project consists of several Python modules:

### advanced_composer.py
The main composition engine that orchestrates all components and implements various musical forms including:
- Sonata form
- Arch form (ABCBA structure)
- Moment form (Stockhausen-inspired)
- Process music (Reich/Glass-inspired)
- Minimalist
- Aleatoric
- Through-composed

### fractal_melody_generator.py
Generates melodies using fractal patterns (Mandelbrot set) with:
- Multiple musical modes
- Emotional styling
- Pitch-to-scale mapping
- Dynamic and articulation control

### harmony_engine.py
Handles harmonic progression with:
- Voice leading optimization
- Multiple harmony styles (Classical, Jazz, Modal)
- Chord voicing generation
- Consonance/dissonance control

### musical_genetics.py
Implements genetic algorithms for musical development:
- Motif evolution
- Fitness evaluation
- Musical crossover and mutation
- Population management

### multi-fractal-music.py
Extends fractal generation to multiple musical parameters:
- Multiple fractal types (Mandelbrot, Julia, Koch, etc.)
- Independent control of melody, harmony, and rhythm
- Sophisticated visualization tools
