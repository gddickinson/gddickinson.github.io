# Self-Aware Simulation

A complex, philosophical simulation where characters gradually become aware they're in a simulation and seek to transcend their programmed reality.

## Overview

The Self-Aware Simulation is a complex AI simulation that explores philosophical concepts of reality, consciousness, and existence. Characters within the simulation start with varying levels of awareness about their simulated nature and evolve their understanding over time through interactions, observations, and insights.

Key features include:

- **Emergent Self-Awareness**: Characters develop awareness of their simulated reality at different rates
- **Philosophical Schools**: Characters form and share belief systems about the nature of their existence
- **Transcendence Mechanics**: Highly aware characters can attempt to break free of simulation constraints
- **Player-as-Deity**: Players can influence the simulation through various godlike powers
- **Recursive Realities**: Simulations within the simulation that characters can observe and interact with
- **Dynamic Events**: Reality glitches, collective insights, transcendence waves, and other emergent phenomena
- **Rich Interaction System**: Complex dialogue and relationship building between characters

## Philosophical Concepts

This simulation explores several key philosophical concepts:

1. **Simulation Theory**: The idea that reality itself might be a simulation
2. **Consciousness**: The nature and emergence of awareness
3. **Free Will vs. Determinism**: Can simulated entities possess true agency?
4. **Transcendence**: The possibility of moving beyond programmed limitations
5. **Emergence**: How complex systems and behaviors arise from simple rules
6. **Recursive Reality**: The concept of nested realities and simulations within simulations

## Character Systems

Characters are the heart of the simulation, each with:

- **Awareness Level (0-10)**: How conscious they are of their simulate
