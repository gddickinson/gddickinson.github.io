# FLIPR Calcium Response Simulator

A comprehensive Python application for simulating FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader) calcium signaling data, with support for various cell types, agonists, Group IDs, and error conditions. This simulator is designed to generate realistic calcium response data for testing analysis pipelines, validating diagnostic assays, and exploring error detection algorithms.

## Overview

The FLIPR Calcium Response Simulator provides a realistic simulation of calcium signaling responses based on published data from autism spectrum disorder research. The application generates time-series fluorescence data that mimics experimental FLIPR readings for different cell types (neurotypical, ASD, FXS, etc.) in response to agonists like ATP.

The software offers a graphical user interface that allows users to design plate layouts, configure simulation parameters, introduce various error conditions, and visualize results. Advanced features include batch processing, error comparison, and data export capabilities that match the format of actual FLIPR instruments.

## Features

### Realistic Calcium Response Simulation
- Simulate physiologically realistic calcium responses based on published literature
- Configure multiple cell types with unique response characteristics
- Implement dose-dependent agonist responses with proper EC50 values
- Generate complex multi-well plate experiments with various cell types and treatments
- Adjust noise parameters to create realistic signal variability

### Interactive Plate Layout Design
- Design custom plate layouts with different cell types, agonists, and concentrations
- Assign Group IDs to categorize and organize experimental conditions
- Visualize layouts with color-coding for easy interpretation
- Save and load plate layouts for reproducible experiments
- Apply patterns to quickly create systematic experimental designs
