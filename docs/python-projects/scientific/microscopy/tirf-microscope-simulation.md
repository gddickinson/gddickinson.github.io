# TIRF Microscope Simulation

## Introduction

This project simulates a Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscope, providing an interactive platform for users to understand and explore the principles of TIRF microscopy. The simulation includes a virtual optical table with adjustable components such as lasers, lenses, and a camera, allowing users to visualize the light path and resulting images in real-time.

## Installation

To run the TIRF microscope simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tirf-microscope-simulation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd tirf-microscope-simulation

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To start the simulation:

1. Run the main script:
python main.py

2. The GUI will open, displaying the optical table view, camera image, and control panel.

3. Use the sliders in the control panel to adjust the laser angles and power.

4. Toggle components on/off using the checkboxes in the component list.

5. Observe the changes in the optical table view and the resulting camera image.

## Components

The simulation includes the following components:

- **Laser**: Emits a beam of light with adjustable angle and power.
- **Lenses**: Refract the light beam.
- **Camera**: Captures the resulting image from the light interaction.
- **Optical Table**: Displays the layout of components and the light path.

## TIRF Microscopy Overview

Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy is an advanced imaging technique used to observe fluorescent molecules near a surface with high contrast and l
