## Overview

Calcium signaling represents one of the most versatile and widespread signaling systems in biology. The spatial and temporal organization of calcium dynamics enables cells to encode complex information processing tasks. This project explores how these principles can be adapted into computational frameworks with applications in machine learning, signal processing, fault-tolerant computing, and more.

## Models

### 1. Probabilistic Computing Based on Calcium Puff Dynamics

This model demonstrates how the probability of signal activation can scale linearly with the number of processing elements, similar to how calcium puff probability scales with IP3R receptor cluster size.

**Key Features:**
- Stochastic computing with predictable probabilities
- Linear relationship between element density and activation probability
- Implementation of probabilistic logic operations

```bash
python probabilistic_computing.py
```

### 2. Spatiotemporal Computing Inspired by Calcium Wave Propagation

This model implements a reaction-diffusion system where information is encoded in wave patterns and processing occurs through their spatiotemporal evolution.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple channels with different diffusion constraints
- Pattern recognition through spatiotemporal dynamics
- Information encoding in spatial configurations

```bash
python spatiotemporal_computing.py
```

### 3. Analog Computing with Calcium-Like Thresholds

This model creates threshold logic units with calcium-like activation properties, demonstrating how com
