# LightSheet Microscopy Viewer and Biological Simulator

A comprehensive application for visualizing, analyzing, and simulating microscopy data with advanced biological modeling capabilities.

![LightSheet Viewer](https://via.placeholder.com/900x500)

## Overview

This project combines a powerful 3D visualization tool for microscopy data with sophisticated simulation capabilities for cellular structures and dynamics. It allows researchers to:

1. Visualize multi-dimensional microscopy data (3D volume, multiple channels, time series)
2. Generate synthetic cellular data with realistic biological properties
3. Simulate complex cellular structures and processes
4. Perform advanced analysis on microscopy data

## Features

### Visualization

- **Interactive 3D Rendering**: View volumetric data with customizable rendering modes (points, surface, wireframe)
- **Multi-View Interface**: Simultaneous XY, XZ, YZ, and 3D views for comprehensive visualization
- **Channel Management**: Independently control visibility, opacity, and color of each channel
- **Time Series Playback**: Animate time series data with adjustable playback speed

### Biological Simulation

- **Cellular Structures**: Generate realistic cell membranes, nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and cytoskeleton
- **Multiple Cell Types**: Simulate spherical, neuronal, epithelial, and muscle cells with appropriate morphologies
- **Protein Dynamics**: Model protein diffusion and active transport along cytoskeletal elements
- **Calcium Signaling**: Simulate various calcium signaling events (waves, puffs, blips)
- **Multi-Cell Interactions**: Model cell-cell adhesion, signaling, and collective behavior

### Data Analysis

- **Blob Detection**: Identify and analyze discrete structures within volumetric data
- **Colocalization Analysis**: Quantify spatial relationships between different channels
- **Intensity Profiling**: Measure intensity distribution along user-defined paths
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculat
