# Cell Edge Movement

Analysis of cell membrane dynamics and protein localization.

---

## Overview

Tools for quantifying cell edge movement and correlating with protein localization, specifically designed for PIEZO1 studies.

---

## Features

- Edge detection and tracking
- Velocity calculations
- PIEZO1 protein analysis
- Correlation with membrane dynamics
- Batch processing

---

## Installation

See [FLIKA Plugins installation](index.md#installation)

---

## Usage

```python
# Access via Plugins → Cell Edge Movement menu
```

---

## Analysis Pipeline

1. Edge detection
2. Movement quantification
3. Protein localization
4. Correlation analysis
