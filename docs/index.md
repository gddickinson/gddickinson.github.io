## Research Interests

My research focuses on calcium signaling, mechanosensitive ion channels, super-resolution microscopy, and computational analysis of biological imaging data. I combine advanced microscopy techniques with software development to study cellular signaling at the single-molecule level.

**Current areas:**
- PIEZO1 mechanosensitive channel localization and function
- Super-resolution microscopy (DNA-PAINT, STORM)
- Single-molecule calcium imaging
- Image analysis software development
